I would recommend this tea to anyone looking to upgrade from the typical store-bought bagged or loose leaf (what I like to call bammer) teas typically found here in the states, or the seasoned connoisseur looking to try something new."

The most frustrating thing<br />about this brand is that it doesn't tear clean and always leaves<br />a stringer that peals back on the roll. This is pretty much for the<br />know-nothings that heard a name so they get this. You are far<br />better off with something like 3M of some other generic at the<br />hardware stores.

51641202,R2X3WJJO8AFCBJ,1,"Capitalizing on a generic name!. This stuff really sticks, especially to your fingers and itself. As<br />for anything else: maybe-maybe not. The most frustrating thing<br />about this brand is that it doesn't tear clean and always leaves<br />a stringer that peals back on the roll. This is pretty much for the<br />know-nothings that heard a name so they get this. You are far<br />better off with something like 3M of some other generic at the<br />hardware stores. This junk is just not worth the frustration!"

It tastes pretty hot as is. However, we put it on pulled pork tonight and the pork mitigated some of the heat.

Ingredients include:<br /><br />All-Natural Gluten Free Ingredients: Water, Tomato Paste, Sugar, Distilled Vinegar, Molasses, Tapioca Dextrin, Salt, Brown Sugar, Spices, Corn Starch, Habanero Peppers, contains less than 0.5% of: Onion, Paprika, Garlic, Chili Powder, Natural Smoke Flavor, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, Guar Gum, Corn Syrup, Tamarind, Natural Flavors.<br /><br />I made turkey meatballs and dipped them in Stubb's BBQ sauce and they are delicious!"

Once we found them, we had to try them out right away. We love Jamba Juice but are rare to find in our state if you don’t want to drive for over an hour from where we are. They are very easy to make, just get ice, water, and a blender and you’re set. You can use water, ice cream, some other kind of liquid form. We did water and then a low fat ice cream, both which worked out very good. They make 2-8 oz, or one giant one. The packs are already filled with everything in the powder so you don’t need to add any vitamins and such to it, but can add protein powder."

17162238,R128WPQTD6TC1Z,5,"tastes nice, good for occasional constipation. This tea tastes good, not as strong or spicy as some chai teas I am used to, but still good.  It has done nothing for my weight; my kids and I drink it occasionally for constipation.  It's great for that, although we do have some mild cramping from the senna, which is to be expected.  It's not a big deal.  I found a box of this at Home Goods, and have been keeping it in the cabinet ever since.  The tea bags are not individually wrapped.  There are 20 per box and the ingredients are:  nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, saffron, senna, cinnamon and allspice.  There is no caffeine in this tea, I like to drink it before bed."

It has done nothing for my weight; my kids and I drink it occasionally for constipation.  It's great for that, although we do have some mild cramping from the senna, which is to be expected.

The mix of oats, nuts and fruit is perfect. You don't get too much of one over the other. It is satisfying as well. After I eat 1/4 cup as a snack, I truly don't want more. It isn't like some things where you just can't stop eating it, leading to overeating. It is nutritious, healthy, and versatile. Nature Valley is a great brand, and I love their granola bars. If you are looking for a great snack, give this a try!"

My husband purchased it, thinking he was buying something more high-end to make for a friend's birthday and the cake is TERRIBLE. We followed the instructions to the letter, but the cupcakes turned out tasteless and a bit dense.  I've made red velvet cakes from other mixes and they turned out fine, so I really do not know what the problem is here.  If I could give it ZERO stars I would. I am so annoyed at having wasted time and money on this mix."

The mango is almost all you taste, until you swallow and feel the slight heat of ginger.  I could only love them more if they were organic, but the ingredients are pretty simple:  cane sugar, ginger, tapioca starch, natural mango flavor.

They are so good, and much better for you than traditional grocery store chips.  I was going to upload a picture, but I ate them all! So good!

I but these in the 5oz bag at Marshalls for $3.  The taste is amazing! They are chewy and full of mango flavor! If you are looking for the ginger flavor, it's pretty much an afterthought.  The mango is almost all you taste, until you swallow and feel the slight heat of ginger.  I could only love them more if they were organic, but the ingredients are pretty simple:  cane sugar, ginger, tapioca starch, natural mango flavor.  They are manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts."

17162238,R2E1NO9MX7PPB4,5,"delicious, non gmo, made in a nut free facility. These are so good, we pick up a bag of the spinach and kale, or beet, every time we are in Marshalls or Home Goods.  I usually pay $2 or $3 for a 6.4oz bag.  They are non gmo, gluten free, vegan, and made in a nut free facility.  You can taste the kale, but my kids eat them anyway (but they won't touch kale..whatever).  The ingredients are simple:  whole grain corn masa flour, sunflower, safflower and or canola oil, spinach, kale, sea salt.  The only thing that would make these better, is if they were made with organic ingredients.  They are flavorful, and still a lot healthier than most grocery store chips.  The bag also says they are a 'product of Mexico', then again, what isn't these days?"

It tastes pretty hot as is. However, we put it on pulled pork tonight and the pork mitigated some of the heat. I think you'll find the intensity depends on what you put it on.<br /><br />I like the original flavor the best, but this may be a close second. Ingredients include:<br /><br />All-Natural Gluten Free Ingredients: Water, Tomato Paste, Sugar, Distilled Vinegar, Molasses, Tapioca Dextrin, Salt, Brown Sugar, Spices, Corn Starch, Habanero Peppers, contains less than 0.5% of: Onion, Paprika, Garlic, Chili Powder, Natural Smoke Flavor, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, Guar Gum, Corn Syrup, Tamarind, Natural Flavors.<br /><br />I made turkey meatballs and dipped them in Stubb's BBQ sauce and they are delicious!"

17162238,R2E1NO9MX7PPB4,5,"delicious, non gmo, made in a nut free facility. These are so good, we pick up a bag of the spinach and kale, or beet, every time we are in Marshalls or Home Goods.  I usually pay $2 or $3 for a 6.4oz bag.  They are non gmo, gluten free, vegan, and made in a nut free facility.  You can taste the kale, but my kids eat them anyway (but they won't touch kale..whatever).  The ingredients are simple:  whole grain corn masa flour, sunflower, safflower and or canola oil, spinach, kale, sea salt.  The only thing that would make these better, is if they were made with organic ingredients.  They are flavorful, and still a lot healthier than most grocery store chips.  The bag also says they are a 'product of Mexico', then again, what isn't these days?"

Though I generally review entertainment products on Amazon I do occasionally review food products and after returned from the Fancy Food Show in New York , this product was sent to me by the manufacturer for an objective review. I had a chance to try it there but I wanted to try it at home.<br /><br />The first thing I look for on a jarred pasta sauce (no, I don’t make my own “gravy”), is the list of ingredients to see where both sugar and tomato paste rank on the list of ingredients. Victoria puts the list on the front of the jar and in print size you can read easily.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients for the Marinara Sauce: 100% Italian tomatoes, Imported Olive Oil, Fresh Garlic, Basil and Onions, Sea Salt & Spices. What? No tomato paste? No sugar? No chemical names? Nope! I still have issues with companies that list the word “spices” without identifying them (I’m guessing there is some oregano here and maybe some pepper but it is not what we call “spicy”) but this sauce tastes freshly made with no chemical or tomato paste taste.<br /><br />It’s pricier than Barilla and other major brands but in line with premium ones like Rao’s. But I like this one better.  I plan to try their vodka sauce too.<br /><br />The 24 oz jar is about 50% larger than most jarred sauces so it’ll last longer and I used it one night over pasta and the next night over pan fried breaded pork chops. Both times it tasty and I can certainly recommend it.<br /><br />It is listed a number of times on Amazon and the price ranges greatly. So look for feedback on seller when you compare the price.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”"

42850283,R3IH33CUXRDZL6,3,"Good But I've Found Something Better!. I bought Nic Nacs because I had fallen in love with this Canadian product, Picard's Crispy Potato Chip Covered Peanuts. Verdict, the Picard's nuts are far superior and cost much less. They sell them here in the States now for $5.99 for a 10.58 oz. bag vs. 4.4 for about $5.00. I think the big difference is that you can actually taste both the peanut and the potato chip coating on the Picard's vs.just a one note flavor crunch on the Nic Nacs. If you like Nic Nacs, you'll LOVE Picard's and can now get them in the States (in lots of different flavours) - chipnutz.com Happy crunching!"

42850283,R3IH33CUXRDZL6,3,"Good But I've Found Something Better!. I bought Nic Nacs because I had fallen in love with this Canadian product, Picard's Crispy Potato Chip Covered Peanuts. Verdict, the Picard's nuts are far superior and cost much less. They sell them here in the States now for $5.99 for a 10.58 oz. bag vs. 4.4 for about $5.00. I think the big difference is that you can actually taste both the peanut and the potato chip coating on the Picard's vs.just a one note flavor crunch on the Nic Nacs. If you like Nic Nacs, you'll LOVE Picard's and can now get them in the States (in lots of different flavours) - chipnutz.com Happy crunching!"

The mix of oats, nuts and fruit is perfect. You don't get too much of one over the other. It is satisfying as well. After I eat 1/4 cup as a snack, I truly don't want more. It isn't like some things where you just can't stop eating it, leading to overeating. It is nutritious, healthy, and versatile. Nature Valley is a great brand, and I love their granola bars. If you are looking for a great snack, give this a try!"

The candies are delicious but they like to stick to the wrapping papers and are sticky themselves so when I peel and eat one I always have to go wash my hands to get the sticky off. I wish they were a bit tougher like the ones which come in the mixed Halloween candy bags, the paper doesn't stick and the candy itself is a bit larger."

The taste is smooth and creamy, rich but not too rich, sweet but not too sweet.<br />I've had the lemon and the vanilla and they're both amazing. The ingredient lists are tiny and they only use whole milk and cream which is probably why it tastes so smooth and creamy. Cane sugar is the only sweetener. In the lemon flavor you can actually see the zest in the yogurt. It's perfect for breakfast or dessert.<br />One serving is 260 calories, which may seem like a lot compared to other &#34;100 calorie&#34; yogurts, but the ingredients are real and the taste can't be beat.

15427008,R23JX3B16A080E,5,GREAT OPTION FOR BABY BREAKFAST. Our baby loves this. We first started with happy bellies cereal (at 4 months) and quickly switched to the oatmeal. The consistency in the container is very small flakes of oatmeal. We add six teaspoons to three teaspoons of banana and three teaspoons of watermelon now (we started this at about six months). We believe this oatmeal has defiantly helped our daughter stay regular. It takes us about 3-4 weeks to go through the container. We love that it is organic and our daughter has had no negative reaction to it.

We believe this oatmeal has defiantly helped our daughter stay regular. It takes us about 3-4 weeks to go through the container. We love that it is organic and our daughter has had no negative reaction to it.

Had hoped that this would be the one but it just isn't for me.  I understand that some people think that coffees such as Starbucks are good but most of those love the flavorings added; I enjoy plain (or really not so plain), black coffee.  Guess my search continues."

34653588,R35HZADP3DIQ0N,1,"HORRID!  BAD TASTE AND SMELL. I just bought 5 of these in the last week from the manufacturer, and it was really horrid!  Bad smell and taste plus dark brown color (maybe the color is supposed to be dark, although the other flavors I bought were clear).  Did not smell or taste like raspberry at all.  Manufacturer said they will issue refund but not pay for return shipping of $7.55, even though the product was bad.  Will not buy this brand again.  So if you want to try it, buy through an auction site like this.  You can get a full refund here, but not through the manufacturer.  Check the Amazon &#34;Online Returns Center&#34; for details."

The taste is a light blueberry flavor, and green tea naturally has a little caffeine, 35 mg.  I drink tea a lot, and Yogi teas are consistently good.

       "Excellent quality and value. I've bought several herbs from Frontier thus far, and as always, I'm satisfied with the quality and freshness of the product.  And the value is incredible.  For the price of about 4 tiny jars (which may not be organic) from the supermarket, I get FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT and it is better quality.  Will definitely order again.  Tip:  I refill my standard-size glass spice jar then seal the remainder of the product in a large vacuum Foodsaver-type bag to preserve better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                7\n",

Stevia is a very healthy and great tasting alternative and natural sweetener but extremely hard to find in current products and if the so-called health food companies would just use it, then it could be called healthy. Also, Saccharin is a very good sweetener that has been given a bad rap for years by the FDA for supposedly causing cancer but has never been proven. I have used &#34;Sweet & Low&#34; daily for over 35 years in my coffee, tea, cereal, etc. and have had virtually no reactions ever and am cancer free!

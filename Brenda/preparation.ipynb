Also, Saccharin is a very good sweetener that has been given a bad rap for years by the FDA for supposedly causing cancer but has never been proven. I have used &#34;Sweet & Low&#34; daily for over 35 years in my coffee, tea, cereal, etc. and have had virtually no reactions ever and am cancer free!
